# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation

- Developed a simulation of various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling, to analyze and compare their performance.
- Implemented efficient data structures and algorithms in Python to model and simulate the scheduling process, optimizing CPU resource allocation and process management.
- Analyzed and visualized scheduling metrics such as average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of each algorithm.
- Utilized Python and libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas for data analysis and visualization, providing actionable insights into CPU scheduling strategies and their impact on system performance.
